# portfolio_website
This is my portfolio website. 

Still a work in progress,I want to add more components to showcase other projects and perfect the responsiveness of the site. 

It has an intro page, a tech portfolio, some of my previous work as a structural engineer and a contact form.

I made it using HTML, SCSS and Vanilla JS for some dinamic effects.
