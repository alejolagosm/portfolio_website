# portfolio_website

This is my portfolio website.

It has an intro page, a tech portfolio, some of my previous work as a structural engineer and a contact form.

I made it using HTML, SCSS and Vanilla JS for some dinamic effects.

In the future, I want to add more components to showcase other projects
